# 102 Class 01

Class 01 of Code 102 introduces the GitHub pages feature of GitHub. It helps a GitHub repo can be shown as a website that we can access through the internet.

In this class, we will create a GitHub repo that's named ```reading-notes```. It will be used as an online note that will append anything we learn in this course by each day. If we forget, we can open it to remember our own knowledge.

* Note: On class 01, We will create a GitHub repo with a ```README.md``` file. After that, use GitHub UI to modify this file without a code editor because the code editor isn't introduced yet.
