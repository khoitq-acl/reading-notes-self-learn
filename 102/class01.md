# 102 Class 01

## Class 01 of Code 102

- Introduce the students about this course (resource, mission, vision, tool,...)
- Explain the growth mindset and fixed mindset and why we should apply the growth mindset for our life
- Introduce markdown and how publish a github page.

## Note

In this class, we will create a GitHub repo that's named ```reading-notes```. It will be used as an online note that will append anything we learn in this course by each day. If we forget, we can open it to remember our own knowledge.

On class 01, We will create a GitHub repo with a ```README.md``` file. After that, use GitHub UI to modify this file without a code editor because the code editor isn't introduced yet.
